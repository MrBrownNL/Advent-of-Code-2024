# Advent of Code 2024 solutions in Python

I use AI as a tool to improve my Python skills, write efficient code, and learn new programming techniques, which significantly accelerated my learning curve and helped me understand complex concepts.

### Open questions
I can use some help with the following code which needs optimizations or to fix crappy code ðŸ˜‰:
- Day 6 part 2 optimized - The code hangs although it finds the answer.


This project is currently a work in progress. The ultimate goal is to auto-generate and execute the solution files by constructing an agent using LangChain which takes the puzzle text as an input.
