# Advent of Code 2024 solutions in Python

## *** Apologies ***
As a side project, I explored automating the process of answering questions to the greatest extent possible. On Day 8 (Part 1), this effort proved so effective that I unintentionally became the first to submit the solutionâ€”forgetting to disable the rule that automatically sends it. Rest assured, I have since made sure that such accidents will not happen again. ðŸ˜Š


I use AI as a tool to improve my Python skills, write efficient code, and learn new programming techniques, which significantly accelerated my learning curve and helped me understand complex concepts.

### Open questions
I can use some help with the following code which needs optimizations or to fix crappy code ðŸ˜‰:
- Day 6 part 2 optimized - The code hangs although it finds the answer.
