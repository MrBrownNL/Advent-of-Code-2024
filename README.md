# Advent of Code 2024 solutions in Python

## *** Apologies ***
As a side project, I explored automating the process of answering questions to the greatest extent possible. On Day 8 (Part 1), this effort proved so effective that I unintentionally became the first to submit the solutionâ€”forgetting to disable the rule that automatically sends it. Rest assured, I have since made sure that such accidents will not happen again. ðŸ˜Š


I use AI as a tool to improve my Python skills, write efficient code, and learn new programming techniques, which significantly accelerated my learning curve and helped me understand complex concepts.

### Day by day learning curve / AI usage
- Day 1: 
  - Used AI for initial code, learned about the zip and map functions. Refactored the code to make it better readable and also helped me to better understand it.
- Day 2: 
  - Used AI for initial code, learned about the all and any functions. Refactored the code to make it better readable and also helped me to better understand it.
- Day 3: 
  - Used AI for initial code, learned about the re module. Refactored the code to make it better readable and also helped me to better understand it.
- Day 4: 
  - Used AI for initial code, this did not work wel for part 2 where it needed refactoring and optimization, learned about the join function and iterating grids. Refactored the code to make it better readable and also helped me to better understand it.
- Day 5: 
  - Lazy day, used AI to generate Python code to solve the puzzles, learned about the set object and reverse function.
- Day 6: 
  - Used the previous learned grid iterating techniques to solve part 1 which was quite easy. I had no idea how to solve part 2 so I borrowed code from @wijnand-gritter and made an attempt to optimize the brute force way which is about 10% faster. I was not satisfied with this and used AI to optimise it using a recursive dfs approach which reduced processing time with 75%!
- Day 7: 
  - Used AI for initial code for part 1, learned about the product module, implemented part 2 and refactored the code.
- Day 8: 
  - Tested my side project on part 1 and accidentally submitted the solution before the daily leaderboard was full (sorry). Also used AI to create the code for part 2 (yes, AI made me a bit lazy today). Learned about the enumerate function.
- Day 9: 
  - AI did not produce satisfying code so I started this one on my own and part 1 was not that hard after all. Part 2 was more challenging and fun to do everything in reverse although it is not very fast (yet). If I have the time I will try to optimize my solution using AI.
- Day 10:
  - My initial code for part 1 generated the answer for part 2 so part 2 was a quick win. Only used AI to optimize and it was pretty close to my code except for the nested dfs function which cleaned up my code a lot.

### Open questions
